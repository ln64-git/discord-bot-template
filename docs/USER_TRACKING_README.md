## Services

### DatabaseService
Central service for all database operations including:
- User CRUD operations
- Message tracking
- Role history management
- Statistics aggregation

### UserTrackingService
Handles user-related events:
- User join/leave detection
- Role change tracking
- Automatic role restoration
- User data updates

### MessageTrackingService

## Usage

The tracking system is automatically initialized when the bot starts. No additional configuration is required.

### Role Restoration
When a user rejoins the server:
1. The system checks if the user has previous role history
2. Retrieves their last known roles
3. Filters out managed roles and roles the bot can't manage
4. Automatically restores the applicable roles

### Data Persistence
All user and message data is stored in MongoDB collections and persists across bot restarts.

## Environment Variables

Make sure you have the following environment variables set:
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Discord bot token
- `GUILD_ID`: (Optional) Guild ID for testing commands

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Database connection errors
- Permission errors for role management
- Missing user data scenarios
- Invalid message data

All errors are logged to the console with appropriate emoji indicators (üîπ for success, üî∏ for warnings, ‚ùå for errors).
